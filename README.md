# stacksort

Inspired by the famous XKCD comic [Ineffective Sorts](https://xkcd.com/1185/).

```
StackSort connects to StackOverflow, searches for 'sort a list', and downloads and runs code snippets until the list is sorted.
```

This is a generalization of my work on [StackSort](https://github.com/buckley-w-david/stacksort).
